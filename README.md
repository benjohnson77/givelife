##Proposal:
Basically after talking thought the idea we ended up feeling that most people do not know that they can register as an organ donor without a trip to the DMV. We feel that churches could aid us in a campaign to increase awareness. As christian's we want to give life whenever possible, we should take the opportunity to register as donors.  

##Solution:
So we created a simple "ad" example page that could be provided to churches, the image and the "ad" could be anything. Click on this link or image or button ... whatever, would go to the landing page. 

https://givelife.herokuapp.com/ad

The landing page does 2 things:
1.The register button is geo targeted to the users state based registration page. They don't have to select from a directory or select their state on a map the link will target them to their nearest registry.
2.Also we have a sharing option already integrated in the page. When the user clicks to move to the registry is opens in a new window so the user will still have the option to share this exciting news. The sharing links will bring more people back to the landing page. 

The landing page and ad code is hosted on Heroku and could easily be shared. 

All the code is posted on GitHub at the following public repo.

##What we learned

We learned a lot about the problem and organizations involved in increasing the donor to population ratio

##What we need

Churches and people to share this information and spread the news that it only takes 60 seconds to save a life.
